# Paper Availability Statements (Draft)

Draft text for manuscript Data Availability and Code Availability statements.

---

## Data Availability Statement

The optimized trajectory configurations, neural network chromosomes, and supporting data artifacts used to produce the results reported in this paper are publicly available in the SOMBRERO GitHub repository at:

> https://github.com/astronadim/sombrero-trajectory-optimizer

The curated data artifacts (Excel files with trajectory time-series and scalar summaries) are included in the repository under `data/paper_artifacts/`. Primary reproducibility is via the provided configuration files, optimized chromosomes, and the `simulate` command as documented in the repository README.

## Code Availability Statement

The SOMBRERO trajectory optimization framework, including the evolutionary neurocontroller, trajectory simulator, and command-line interface, is publicly available under the MIT License at:

> https://github.com/astronadim/sombrero-trajectory-optimizer

The repository includes configuration files and optimized chromosomes for hot-start reconstruction of the paper's reference trajectories (Tables 3 and 4). Installation instructions, dependency requirements, and quickstart commands are provided in the repository README.
